- **About FORMAT DATA:**
  * **Things to keep in mind before format:** Formatting your phone will wipe all the data. This data includes photos, videos, documents, applications, games, call logs etc. That's why you should make sure to have a backup before format. You can copy your necessary files on a pendrive, sdcard, PC and also can save large media files on cloud storage like Google Drive or OneDrive. Restoring your data from this backup is easy.
