### :warning: Read this before you ran into problems such as bootloop, stuck at MI logo or Recovery logo:
Formatting data is sometimes needed for Android 13 ROMs as well. If you're coming from a stock/custom MIUI ROM or any AOSP Custom ROM which showing **"PHONE IS ENCRYPTED"**; it needs to do **FORMAT DATA in recovery** right after flashing any Android 13 ROM, Then Reboot to system. You don't need to format again for flashing another Android 13 ROM, .

**To know whether your PHONE IS ENCRYPTED or NOT:** [Go to Settings > Security > Encryption & credentials] or [Search for "encryption" in settings search]

### ðŸ§¹About FORMAT DATA:
  * **Things to keep in mind before format:** Formatting your phone will wipe all the data. This data includes photos, videos, documents, applications, games, call logs etc. That's why you should make sure to have a backup before format. You can copy your necessary files on a pendrive, sdcard, PC and also can save large media files on cloud storage like Google Drive or OneDrive. Restoring your data from this backup is easy.
